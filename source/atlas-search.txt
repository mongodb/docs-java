Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the **Atlas Search** feature on a collection.
Atlas Search enables you to perform full-text searches on collections hosted on MongoDB
Atlas. Atlas Search indexes specify the behavior of the search and which fields to index.

Run an Atlas Search Query
-------------------------

This section shows how to create an aggregation pipeline to run an
Atlas Search on a collection. You can use ``Aggregates.search`` builder to
create a ``$search`` pipeline stage and specify your search. Then, call
the ``aggregate()`` method and pass your pipeline as a parameter.

.. tip:: 

   To learn more about aggregation operations and builders, see the :ref:`java-aggregation`
   guide. 

Before running an Atlas Search query, you must create an Atlas Search index
on your collection. To learn how to programmatically create an Atlas Search
index, see the :ref:`java-search-indexes` section in the Indexes guide. 

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The example in this section uses the ``movies`` collection in the ``sample_mflix``
database from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To learn how to
create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
:atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started>` guide.

Atlas Search Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example performs an Atlas Search query by calling the
``aggregate()`` method and passing the following pipeline stages:

- ``Aggregates.search``: Specifies a search query for documents in which
  the ``title`` field contains the word ``"Alabama"``
- ``Aggregates.project``: Projects the ``title`` field of each matching document

   .. input:: /includes/AtlasSearch.java
      :start-after: begin-atlas-search
      :end-before: end-atlas-search
      :language: java
      :dedent:

   .. output:: 
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      {"_id": {"$oid": "..."}, "title": "Alabama Moon"}
      {"_id": {"$oid": "..."}, "title": "Crazy in Alabama"}
      {"_id": {"$oid": "..."}, "title": "Sweet Home Alabama"}
