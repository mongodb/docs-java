=============
Run a Command
=============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can run all raw database operations using the
``MongoDatabase.runCommand()`` method. Call the ``runCommand()`` method
with your command object on an instance of a database for diagnostic and
administrative tasks such as fetching server stats or initializing a
replica set.

.. note::
    Use the :manual:`mongo shell </reference/mongo-shell>` for
    administrative tasks instead of the Java Driver whenever possible.

The ``runCommand()`` method accepts a :manual:`command
<reference/command/>` in Bson format. By default, ``runCommand`` returns
an object of type ``org.bson.Document`` containing the output of the
database command.

You can specify a :manual:`read preference <core/read-preference/>` or
a return type for ``runCommand()`` as an optional second parameter. To
specify both a read preference and a return type, pass the read
preference as a second parameter and the return type as a third
parameter.

Example
-------

.. include:: /includes/connect-guide-note.rst

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/code-snippets/Command.java
  :language: java
  :linenos:


When you run the above command, you should see output similar to the
following:

.. code-block:: none

   dbStats: {"db": "sample_mflix", "collections": 5, "views": 0, "objects": 75595, "avgObjSize": 692.1003770090614, "dataSize": 52319328, "storageSize": 29831168, "numExtents": 0, "indexes": 9, "indexSize": 14430208, "fileSize": 0, "nsSizeMB": 0, "ok": 1}
