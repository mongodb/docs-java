=========================
Insert Multiple Documents
=========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can insert multiple documents into a collection in a single
operation by calling the ``insertMany()`` method on a ``MongoCollection``
object. To insert them, add your ``Document`` objects to a ``List`` and pass
it to your call to ``insertMany()``. If you call the ``insertMany()`` method
on a collection that does not exist yet, the server creates it for you.

Upon successful insert, ``insertMany()`` returns an instance of
``InsertManyResult``. You can retrieve information such as the ``_id``
fields of the documents you inserted by calling the ``getInsertedIds()``
method on the ``InsertManyResult``.

If your insert operation fails, the driver raises an exception. For more
information on the types of exceptions raised under specific conditions,
see the API documentation for ``insertMany()``, linked at the bottom of
this page.

Example
-------

The following snippet inserts multiple documents into the ``movies``
collection.

.. include:: /includes/connect-guide-note.rst

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/code-snippets/InsertMany.java
   :language: java

When you run the example, you should see output that resembles the following
with the inserted document ``ObjectId`` in each of the value fields:

.. code-block:: none

   Inserted document ids: {0=BsonObjectId{value=...}, 1=BsonObjectId{value=...}}
