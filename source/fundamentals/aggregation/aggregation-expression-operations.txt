Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-long+} to construct
expressions for use in the aggregation pipeline. You can perform
expression operations with discoverable, typesafe Java methods rather
than BSON documents. Because these methods follow the fluent interface
pattern, you can chain aggregation operations together to create code
that is both more compact and more naturally readable.

.. tip:: 

   For more information about aggregation expressions that use the Query API, see the 
   :manual:`Aggregation Pipeline Operators </reference/operator/aggregation/>` 
   page in the Server manual.

Operations
----------

The following sections provide information and examples for
aggregation expression operations available in the driver.
The operations are categorized by purpose and functionality.

.. important::

   The driver generates a Query API expression that may be different
   from the Query API expression provided in each example. However,
   the expressions are equivalent when evaluated.

Boolean Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can construct a boolean expression from values of type
``MqlBoolean`` and boolean aggregation operations. These 
expressions evaluate to ``true`` or ``false``.

The following table describes boolean aggregation expression operators
available in the driver and equivalent expressions in the
Query API. The methods link to API documentation and the Query API
expressions link to Server manual documentation.

.. note::

   Some aggregation methods share a name with other methods available in
   the driver. Check the parameter types and the type of
   the object that the method is called on to confirm that that you are
   referencing the correct documentation.

The following code uses the ``or()`` method to set the ``extreme``
field to ``true`` if the value of ``temperature`` is less than ``10`` or
greater than ``95`` and ``false`` otherwise:

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: true

   import java.util.Arrays;
   import static com.mongodb.client.model.Aggregates.*;
   import static com.mongodb.client.model.Projections.*;
   import static com.mongodb.client.model.mql.MqlValues.*;

   // <class definition, main method, and setup code here>

   var pipeline = Arrays.asList(project(fields(
           computed("extreme",
                   current().getInteger("temperature").lt(of(10))
                       .or(current().getInteger("temperature").gt(of(95))))
   )));
      
The following code provides an equivalent expression in
the Query API:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: true

   {
     $project:
        {
          extreme: { $or: [ { $lt: [ "$temperature", 10 ] }, { $gt: [ "$temperature", 95 ] } ] }
        }
   }
