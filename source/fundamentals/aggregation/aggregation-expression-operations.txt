Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-long+} to construct
expressions for use in the aggregation pipeline. You can perform
expression operations with discoverable, typesafe Java methods rather
than BSON documents. Because these methods follow the fluent interface
pattern, you can chain aggregation operations together to create code
that is both more compact and more naturally readable.

The operations in this guide use methods from the
`com.mongodb.client.model.mql <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/mql/package-summary.html>`__ package.
These methods provide an idiomatic way to use the Query API,
the mechanism by which the driver interacts with the {+mdb-server+}. To learn more
about the Query API, see the :manual:`Server manual documentation </query-api/>`.

How to Use Operations
---------------------

The examples in this guide assume that you include the following static
imports in your code:

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: true

   import static com.mongodb.client.model.Aggregates.*;
   import static com.mongodb.client.model.Projections.*;
   import static com.mongodb.client.model.Filters.*;
   import static com.mongodb.client.model.mql.MqlValues.*;
   import static java.util.Arrays.asList;

To access document fields in an expression, you need to reference the
document being processed by the aggregation pipeline. Use the
``current()`` method to refer to this document. To access the value of a
field, you must use the appropriately typed method, such as
``getString()`` or ``getDate()``. When you specify the type for a field,
you ensure that the driver provides only those methods which are
compatible with that type. The following code shows how to reference a
string field called ``name``:

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: true
   
   current().getString("name")

To specify a value in an operation, pass it to the ``of()`` method to
convert it to a valid type. The following code shows how to reference a
value of ``1.0``:

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: true
   
   of(1.0)

To create an operation, chain a method to your field or value reference.
You can build more complex operations by chaining additional methods.

The following example creates an operation to find patients in New
Mexico who have visited the doctor’s office at least once. The operation
performs the following actions:

- Checks if the size of the ``visitDates`` array is greater than ``0``
  by using the ``gt()`` method 
- Checks if the ``state`` field value is “New Mexico” by using the
  ``eq()`` method

The ``and()`` method links these operations so that the pipeline stage
matches only documents that meet both criteria.

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: true
      
   current()
         .getArray("visitDates")
         .size()
         .gt(of(0))
         .and(current()
                 .getString("state")
                 .eq(of("New Mexico")));

While some aggregation stages, such as ``group()``, accept operations
directly, other stages expect that you first include your operation in a
method such as ``computed()`` or ``expr()``. These methods, which take
values of type ``TExpression``, allow you to use your expressions in
certain aggregations.

To complete your aggregation pipeline stage, include your expression
in an aggregates builder method. The following list provides examples of
how to include your expression in common aggregates builder methods:

- ``match(expr(<expression>))``
- ``project(fields(computed("<field name>", <expression>)))``
- ``group(<expression>)``

To learn more about these methods, see
:ref:`Aggregates Builders <aggregates-builders>`.

The examples use the ``Arrays.asList()`` method to create a list of
aggregation stages that is passed to the ``aggregate()`` method of
``MongoCollection``.

Operations
----------

The following sections provide information and examples for
aggregation expression operations available in the driver.
The operations are categorized by purpose and functionality.

Each section has a table that describes aggregation methods
available in the driver and corresponding expression operators in the
Query API. The method names link to API documentation and the
aggregation pipeline operator names link to descriptions and examples in
the Server manual documentation.

.. note::

   The driver generates a Query API expression that may be different
   from the Query API expression provided in each example. However,
   both expressions will produce the same aggregation result.

Boolean Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can perform a boolean operation on a value of type ``MqlBoolean``
using the methods described in this section.

The following table describes boolean methods
available in the driver and corresponding expressions in the
Query API. The methods link to API documentation and the Query API
expressions link to Server manual documentation.

The following example specifies an extreme temperature advisory for very
low or high weather temperatures (in degrees Fahrenheit). The code uses
the ``or()`` method to evaluate if the value of ``temperature`` is less
than ``10`` or greater than ``95``. Using the ``cond()`` method, the
example sets the ``advisory`` field to ``"extreme temperature"`` if the
document matches the criteria, and to ``"no advisory"`` otherwise:

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: true

   var pipeline = Arrays.asList(project(fields(
           computed("advisory",
                   current()
                           .getInteger("temperature")
                           .lt(of(10))
                           .or(current()
                                   .getInteger("temperature")
                                   .gt(of(95)))
                           .cond(of("extreme temperature"), of("no advisory"))
   ))));

The following code provides an equivalent expression in
the Query API:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: true

   { $project: { advisory: { $cond: { if: { $or: [ { $lt: [ "$temperature", 10 ] },
                                                   { $gt: [ "$temperature", 95 ] } ] },
                                      then: "extreme temperature",
                                      else: "no advisory" } } } }

Suppose you have a collection which has a generic parameter used to store
miscellaneous customer data. What you want to do with that data varies,
depending on the type of data that is stored.

To change what you are doing based on the data type of ``miscData``, use the
``switchOn()`` method. If the data type is ``String``, just copy the data
without altering it. If the data type is ``Boolean``, check the value with the
``cond()`` method and return a string indicating whether the customer is a
premium member. If the data type is ``Array``, get the first element by using
the ``elementAt()`` method. If it is not one of these types, record a message
by using ``defaults()``. Regardless of the type, use the ``project()`` method
to output the result as ``result``.

The following code shows the pipeline stage for this aggregation:

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: true

   Arrays.asList(project(fields(
         computed("result",
               current().getField("miscData").switchOn(field -> field
                        .isString(s -> s)
                        .isBoolean(b -> b.cond(
                                 of("Customer is premium member"),
                                 of("Customer is not premium member")))
                        .isArray(a -> a.elementAt(0).asString())
                        .defaults(d -> of("Not an anticipated type"))
               ))
   )));

The following code provides an equivalent aggregation pipeline in
the Query API:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: true

   [
     {
       $project: {
         result: {
           $switch: {
             branches: [
               { case:
                 { $eq: [ { $type: "$miscData" }, "string" ] },
                 then:
                   "$miscData" },
               { case:
                 { $eq: [ { $type: "$miscData" }, "bool" ] },
                 then:
                   { $cond: { if: "$miscData",
                     then: "Customer is premium member",
                     else: "Customer is not premium member" } } },
               { case:
                 { $eq: [ { $type: "$miscData" }, "array" ] },
                 then:
                   { $toString: { $arrayElemAt: [ "$miscData", 0 ] } } }
             ],
             default: "Not an anticipated type"
           }
         }
       }
     }
   ]

Set Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can perform set operations on values of type ``MqlArray``. These
operations treat the arrays as sets.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Java Method
     - Aggregation Pipeline Operator

   * - `union() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/mql/MqlArray.html#union(com.mongodb.client.model.mql.MqlArray)>`__
     - :manual:`$setUnion </reference/operator/aggregation/setUnion/>`
       
.. include:: /includes/fundamentals/agg-mql-diff.rst

Suppose you have a collection describing music teachers, and for each teacher,
there are arrays of students for each of their classes. You want to create a
list of all the students a teacher has by combining the class rosters.

To combine the ``pianoStudents`` and ``choirStudents`` arrays, use the
``union()`` method. To output the result as a new ``allStudents`` field, use
the ``project()`` method.

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: true

   Arrays.asList(project(fields(
         computed("allStudents",
               current()
                     .getArray("pianoStudents")
                     .union((current()
                           .getArray("choirStudents"))))
   )));


The following code provides an equivalent aggregation pipeline in
the Query API:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: true

   [
     {
       $project: {
         allStudents: {
            $setUnion: ["$pianoStudents", "$choirStudents"]
         }
       }
     }
   ]

You can perform a string operation on a value of type ``MqlString``
using the methods described in this section.

Suppose you need to generate lowercase usernames for employees of a
company from the employees' last names and employee IDs.

To concatenate the ``lastName`` and ``employeeID`` fields,
use the ``append()`` method. To make the username lowercase, use the
``toLower()`` method. To output the result as the ``username`` field,
use the ``project()`` method.

The following code shows the pipeline stage for this aggregation:

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: true

   Arrays.asList(project(fields(
           computed("username",
                   current()
                           .getString("lastName")
                           .append(current()
                                   .getString("employeeID"))
                           .toLower()
   ))));

The following code provides an equivalent aggregation pipeline in
the Query API:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: true

   [
     {
       $project: {
         username: {
           $toLower: {
             $concat: ["$lastName", "$employeeID"],
           }
         }
       }
     }
   ]
