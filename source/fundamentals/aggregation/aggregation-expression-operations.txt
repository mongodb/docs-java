Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-long+} to construct
expressions for use in the aggregation pipeline. You can perform
expression operations with discoverable, typesafe Java methods rather
than BSON documents. Because these methods follow the fluent interface
pattern, you can chain aggregation operations together to create code
that is both more compact and more naturally readable.

.. tip:: 

   For more information about aggregation expressions that use the Query API, see the 
   :manual:`Aggregation Pipeline Operators </reference/operator/aggregation/>` 
   page in the Server manual.

How to Use Operations
---------------------

The operations in this guide use static methods available in the
``com.mongodb.client.model.mql`` package. To run the examples in this
guide, consider importing the following classes in your program:

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: true

   import static com.mongodb.client.model.Aggregates.*;
   import static com.mongodb.client.model.Projections.*;
   import static com.mongodb.client.model.Filters.*;
   import static com.mongodb.client.model.mql.MqlValues.*;
   import static java.util.Arrays.asList;

The examples use the ``Arrays.asList()`` method to create a list of
aggregation operations that can be passed as a pipeline to the
``aggregate()`` method.

To construct an operation, first select a method that takes a value of
type ``TExpression`` as a parameter, such as ``Projections.computed()``
or ``Filters.expr()``. To reference document fields in an aggregation
expression, obtain the "current" document being processed
in the pipeline stage by calling the ``current()`` method. 

Since the aggregation operations are typed, you must specify the type of each
field you reference using a typed variation of the ``getField()``
method, such as ``getString()`` or ``getDate()``. The following code
shows how to reference an integer field called ``quantity``:

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: true

   var myField = current().getInteger("quantity");

To reference a constant value, use the ``of()`` method, which converts
primitive types to types that can be used in aggregation operations. The
following code shows how to reference a constant of value ``1.0``:

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: true

   var myNum = of(1.0);

When you finish composing an aggregation operation, you can pass it to
an aggregation builder method, such as ``match()`` or ``project()`` to
complete an aggregation pipeline stage. To learn more about these methods,
see :ref:`Aggregates Builders <aggregates-builders>`.

.. note::
   
   While these new operations can be used within existing aggregation
   methods that take ``TExpression`` values, methods that return
   ``Bson`` values are not usable with this feature.

Operations
----------

The following sections provide information and examples for
aggregation expression operations available in the driver.
The operations are categorized by purpose and functionality.

.. note::

   The driver generates a Query API expression that may be different
   from the Query API expression provided in each example. However,
   both expressions will produce the same aggregation result.

Boolean Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can perform a boolean operation on a value of type ``MqlBoolean``
using the methods described in this section.

The following table describes boolean methods
available in the driver and corresponding expressions in the
Query API. The methods link to API documentation and the Query API
expressions link to Server manual documentation.

The following example specifies an extreme temperature advisory for very
low or high weather temperatures (in degrees Fahrenheit). The code uses
the ``or()`` method to evaluate if the value of ``temperature`` is less
than ``10`` or greater than ``95``. Using the ``cond()`` method, the
example sets the ``advisory`` field to ``"extreme temperature"`` if the
document matches the criteria, and to ``"no advisory"`` otherwise:

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: true

   var pipeline = Arrays.asList(project(fields(
           computed("advisory",
                   current()
                           .getInteger("temperature")
                           .lt(of(10))
                           .or(current()
                                   .getInteger("temperature")
                                   .gt(of(95)))
                           .cond(of("extreme temperature"), of("no advisory"))
   ))));

The following code provides an equivalent expression in
the Query API:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: true

   { $project: { advisory: { $cond: { if: { $or: [ { $lt: [ "$temperature", 10 ] },
                                                   { $gt: [ "$temperature", 95 ] } ] },
                                      then: "extreme temperature",
                                      else: "no advisory" } } } }
