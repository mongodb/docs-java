Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-long+} to construct
expressions for use in the aggregation pipeline. You can perform
expression operations with discoverable, typesafe Java methods rather
than BSON documents. Because these methods follow the fluent interface
pattern, you can chain aggregation operations together to create code
that is both more compact and more naturally readable.

The operations in this guide use methods from the
`com.mongodb.client.model.mql <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/mql/package-summary.html>`__ package.
These methods provide an idiomatic way to use the Query API,
the mechanism by which the driver interacts with the {+mdb-server+}. To learn more
about the Query API, see the :manual:`Server manual documentation </query-api/>`.

How to Use Operations
---------------------

The examples in this guide assume that you include the following static
imports in your code:

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: true

   import static com.mongodb.client.model.Aggregates.*;
   import static com.mongodb.client.model.Projections.*;
   import static com.mongodb.client.model.Filters.*;
   import static com.mongodb.client.model.mql.MqlValues.*;
   import static java.util.Arrays.asList;

To access document fields in an expression, you need to reference the
document being processed by the aggregation pipeline. Use the
``current()`` method to refer to this document. To access the value of a
field, you must use the appropriately typed method, such as
``getString()`` or ``getDate()``. When you specify the type for a field,
you ensure that the driver provides only those methods which are
compatible with that type. The following code shows how to reference a
string field called ``name``:

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: true
   
   current().getString("name")

To specify a value in an operation, pass it to the ``of()`` method to
convert it to a valid type. The following code shows how to reference a
value of ``1.0``:

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: true
   
   of(1.0)

To create an operation, chain a method to your field or value reference.
You can build more complex operations by chaining additional methods.

The following example creates an operation to find patients in New
Mexico who have visited the doctor’s office at least once. The operation
performs the following actions:

- Checks if the size of the ``visitDates`` array is greater than ``0``
  by using the ``gt()`` method 
- Checks if the ``state`` field value is “New Mexico” by using the
  ``eq()`` method

The ``and()`` method links these operations so that the pipeline stage
matches only documents that meet both criteria.

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: true
      
   current()
         .getArray("visitDates")
         .size()
         .gt(of(0))
         .and(current()
                 .getString("state")
                 .eq(of("New Mexico")));

While some aggregation stages, such as ``group()``, accept operations
directly, other stages expect that you first include your operation in a
method such as ``computed()`` or ``expr()``. These methods, which take
values of type ``TExpression``, allow you to use your expressions in
certain aggregations.

To complete your aggregation pipeline stage, include your expression
in an aggregates builder method. The following list provides examples of
how to include your expression in common aggregates builder methods:

- ``match(expr(<expression>))``
- ``project(fields(computed("<field name>", <expression>)))``
- ``group(<expression>)``

To learn more about these methods, see
:ref:`Aggregates Builders <aggregates-builders>`.

The examples use the ``Arrays.asList()`` method to create a list of
aggregation stages that is passed to the ``aggregate()`` method of
``MongoCollection``.

Operations
----------

The following sections provide information and examples for
aggregation expression operations available in the driver.
The operations are categorized by purpose and functionality.

Each section has a table that describes aggregation methods
available in the driver and corresponding expression operators in the
Query API. The method names link to API documentation and the
aggregation pipeline operator names link to descriptions and examples in
the Server manual documentation.

.. note::

   The driver generates a Query API expression that may be different
   from the Query API expression provided in each example. However,
   both expressions will produce the same aggregation result.

Boolean Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can perform a boolean operation on a value of type ``MqlBoolean``
using the methods described in this section.

The following table describes boolean methods
available in the driver and corresponding expressions in the
Query API. The methods link to API documentation and the Query API
expressions link to Server manual documentation.

The following example specifies an extreme temperature advisory for very
low or high weather temperatures (in degrees Fahrenheit). The code uses
the ``or()`` method to evaluate if the value of ``temperature`` is less
than ``10`` or greater than ``95``. Using the ``cond()`` method, the
example sets the ``advisory`` field to ``"extreme temperature"`` if the
document matches the criteria, and to ``"no advisory"`` otherwise:

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: true

   var pipeline = Arrays.asList(project(fields(
           computed("advisory",
                   current()
                           .getInteger("temperature")
                           .lt(of(10))
                           .or(current()
                                   .getInteger("temperature")
                                   .gt(of(95)))
                           .cond(of("extreme temperature"), of("no advisory"))
   ))));

The following code provides an equivalent expression in
the Query API:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: true

   { $project: { advisory: { $cond: { if: { $or: [ { $lt: [ "$temperature", 10 ] },
                                                   { $gt: [ "$temperature", 95 ] } ] },
                                      then: "extreme temperature",
                                      else: "no advisory" } } } }

Suppose you have data about package deliveries and need to match
deliveries that occurred on any Monday in the ``"America/New_York"`` time
zone.

If the ``deliveryDate`` field contains any string values representing
valid dates, such as ``"2018-01-15T16:00:00Z"`` or ``Jan 15, 2018, 12:00
PM EST``, you can use the ``parseDate()`` method to convert the strings
into date types.

To get the day of the week (as a number) from the date, use the ``dayOfWeek()``
method and pass ``"America/New_York"`` as a parameter to specify that
you are using that time zone to define when Monday is. Use the
``eq()`` method to check if the day value is ``2``, corresponding to Monday.

The following code shows the pipeline stage for this aggregation:

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: true

   Arrays.asList(match(
        expr(current()
                .getString("deliveryDate")
                .parseDate()
                .dayOfWeek(of("America/New_York"))
                .eq(of(2)))
   ));

The following code provides an equivalent aggregation pipeline in
the Query API:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: true

   [
     { $match: {
         $expr: {
           $eq: [
             {
               $dayOfWeek: { date: { $dateFromString: 
                                       { dateString: "$deliveryDate" } },
                             timezone: "America/New_York" }
             }, 2 ] } }
     }
   ]

Custom Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can apply custom functions to values of type
``MqlValue`` using the methods described in this section.

To improve readability and allow for code reuse, you can move redundant
code into static methods. However, it is not possible to directly chain
static methods in Java. The ``passTo()`` method lets you chain values
into custom static methods.

Suppose you need to determine how a class is performing against some
benchmarks. You want to find the average final grade for each class and
compare it against the benchmark values.

To calculate each class average, write an averaging method called
``gradeAverage()`` and pass the ``students`` array to this method by using
the ``passArrayTo()`` method. To compare each class average against your
defined benchmarks, write a method called ``evaluate()``. Apply this
method to the class averages by chaining the ``passNumberTo()`` method
to the previous method. To output the result as the ``evaluation``
field, use the ``project()`` method.

The following code shows sample implementations of the methods used in
this aggregation:

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: true

   public static MqlNumber gradeAverage(MqlArray<MqlDocument> students, String fieldName) {
       var sum = students.sum(student -> student.getInteger(fieldName));
       var avg = sum.divide(students.size());
       return avg;
   }

   public static MqlString evaluate(MqlNumber avg, MqlNumber[] benchmarks) {
       var msg = avg.switchOn(on -> on
               .lte(benchmarks[0], m -> of("Needs improvement"))
               .lte(benchmarks[1], m -> of("Meets expectations"))
               .defaults(m -> of("Exceeds expectations")));
       return msg;
   }

.. tip::

   One advantage of using the ``passTo()`` method is that you can reuse
   your custom methods for other aggregations. You could
   use the ``gradeAverage()`` method to find the average of grades for
   groups of students filtered by, for example, entry year or district, not just their
   class. You could use the ``evaluate()`` method to evaluate, for
   example, an individual student's performance, or an entire school's or
   district's performance.

The following code shows the pipeline stage for this aggregation:

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: true

   Arrays.asList(project(fields(
           computed("evaluation",
                   current().<MqlDocument>getArray("students")
                           .passArrayTo(students -> gradeAverage(students, "finalGrade"))
                           .passNumberTo(grade -> evaluate(grade, new MqlNumber[]{of(70), of(85)}))
   ))));

The following code provides an equivalent aggregation pipeline in
the Query API:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: true

   [
     {
       $project: {
         evaluation: {
           $switch: {
             branches: [
               { case: { $lte: [ { $avg: "$students.finalGrade" }, 70 ] },
                 then: "Needs improvement"
               },
               { case: { $lte: [ { $avg: "$students.finalGrade" }, 85 ] },
                 then: "Meets expectations"
               }
             ],
             default: "Exceeds expectations" } } }
     }
   ]

Suppose you need to generate lowercase usernames for employees of a
company from the employees' last names and employee IDs.

To concatenate the ``lastName`` and ``employeeID`` fields,
use the ``append()`` method. To make the username lowercase, use the
``toLower()`` method. To output the result as the ``username`` field,
use the ``project()`` method.

The following code shows the pipeline stage for this aggregation:

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: true

   Arrays.asList(project(fields(
           computed("username",
                   current()
                           .getString("lastName")
                           .append(current()
                                   .getString("employeeID"))
                           .toLower()
   ))));
   
The following code provides an equivalent aggregation pipeline in
the Query API:
