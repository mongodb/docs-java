   * - Option Name
     - Type
     - Description

   * - **minPoolSize**
     - integer
     - Specifies the minimum number of connections that must exist at
       any moment in a single connection pool.

   * - **maxPoolSize**
     - integer
     - Specifies the maximum number of connections that a connection
       pool may have at a given time.

   * - **waitQueueTimeoutMS**
     - integer
     - Specifies the maximum amount of time, in milliseconds that a
       thread may wait for a connection to become available.

   * - **serverSelectionTimeoutMS**
     - integer
     - Specifies the maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, the driver
       will wait for server selection to succeed before throwing an
       exception.

   * - **localThresholdMS**
     - integer
     - When communicating with multiple instances of MongoDB in a replica
       set, the driver will only send requests to a server whose
       response time is less than or equal to the server with the fastest
       response time plus the local threshold, in milliseconds.

   * - **heartbeatFrequencyMS**
     - integer
     - Specifies the frequency, in milliseconds that the driver will
       wait between attempts to determine the current state of each
       server in the cluster.

   * - **replicaSet**
     - string
     - Specifies that the :ref:`connection string <connection-uri>`
       provided includes multiple hosts. When specified, the driver
       attempts to find all members of that set.

   * - **ssl**
     - boolean
     - Specifies that all communication with MongoDB instances should
       use TLS/SSL. Superseded by the **tls** option.

   * - **tls**
     - boolean
     - Specifies that all communication with MongoDB instances should
       use TLS. Supersedes the **ssl** option.

   * - **tlsInsecure**
     - boolean
     - Specifies that the driver should allow invalid hostnames for TLS
       connections. Has the same effect as setting
       **tlsAllowInvalidHostnames** to ``true``. To configure TLS security
       constraints in other ways, use a
       :ref:`custom SSLContext <tls-custom-sslContext>`.

   * - **tlsAllowInvalidHostnames**
     - boolean
     - Specifies that the driver should allow invalid hostnames in the
       certificate for TLS connections. Supersedes
       **sslInvalidHostNameAllowed**.

   * - **connectTimeoutMS**
     - integer
     - Specifies the maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, the Java
       driver waits for a connection to open before timing out.

   * - **socketTimeoutMS**
     - integer
     - Specifies the maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, the Java
       driver will wait to send or receive a request before timing out.

   * - **maxIdleTimeMS**
     - integer
     - Specifies the maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, the Java
       driver will allow a pooled connection to idle before closing the
       connection.

   * - **maxLifeTimeMS**
     - integer
     - Specifies the maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, the Java
       driver will continue to use a pooled connection before closing the
       connection.

   * - **journal**
     - boolean
     - Specifies that the driver must wait for the connected MongoDB
       instance to group commit to the journal file on disk for all writes.

   * - **w**
     - string or integer
     - Specifies the write concern. For more information on values, see
       the server documentation for the :manual:`w option
       </reference/write-concern/#w-option>`.

   * - **wtimeoutMS**
     - integer
     - Specifies a time limit, in milliseconds, for the write concern. For
       more information, see the server documentation for the
       :manual:`wtimeoutMS option </reference/connection-string/#write-concern-options>`.

   * - **readPreference**
     - string
     - Specifies the read preference. For more information on values, see
       the server documentation for the
       :manual:`readPreference option </reference/connection-string/#urioption.readPreference>`.

   * - **readPreferenceTags**
     - string
     - Specifies the read preference tags. For more information on values, see
       the server documentation for the
       :manual:`readPreferenceTags option </reference/connection-string/#urioption.readPreferenceTags>`.

   * - **maxStalenessSeconds**
     - integer
     - Specifies, in seconds, how stale a secondary can be before the
       driver stops communicating with that secondary. Not providing
       a parameter or explicitly setting it to ``-1`` indicates that there
       should be no staleness check for secondaries. The minimum value is
       either 90 seconds or the heartbeat frequency plus 10 seconds, whichever
       is greater. For more information, see the server documentation for the
       :manual:`maxStalenessSeconds option </reference/connection-string/#urioption.maxStalenessSeconds>`.

   * - **authMechanism**
     - string
     - Specifies the :doc:`authentication mechanism
       </fundamentals/auth>` that the driver should use if a credential
       was supplied. By default, the client picks the most secure
       mechanism available based on the server version. For possible
       values, see the server documentation for the
       :manual:`authMechanism option
       </reference/connection-string/#urioption.authMechanism>`.

   * - **authSource**
     - string
     - Specifies the database that the supplied credentials should be
       validated against. Defaults to ``admin``.

   * - **authMechanismProperties**
     - string
     - Specifies authentication properties for the specified authentication
       mechanism as a list of colon-separated properties and values.
       For more information, see the server documentation for
       the :manual:`authMechanismProperties option
       </reference/connection-string/#urioption.authMechanismProperties>`.

   * - **appName**
     - string
     - Specifies the name of the application provided to MongoDB instances
       during the connection handshake. Can be used for server logs and
       profiling.

   * - **compressors**
     - string
     - Specifies one or more compression algorithms that the driver
       will attempt to use to compress requests sent to the connected
       MongoDB instance. Possible values include: ``zlib``, ``snappy``,
       and ``zstd``.

   * - **zlibCompressionLevel**
     - integer
     - Specifies the degree of compression that `Zlib <https://zlib.net/>`__
       should use to decrease the size of requests to the connected MongoDB 
       instance. The level can range from ``-1`` to ``9``, with lower values 
       compressing faster (but resulting in larger requests) and larger values 
       compressing slower (but resulting in smaller requests).

   * - **retryWrites**
     - boolean
     - Specifies that the driver must retry supported write operations
       if they fail due to a network error. Defaults to ``true``.

   * - **retryReads**
     - boolean
     - Specifies that the driver must retry supported read operations
       if they fail due to a network error. Defaults to ``true``.

   * - **uuidRepresentation**
     - string
     - Specifies the UUID representation to use for read and write
       operations. For more information, see the driver documentation
       for the
       `MongoClientSettings.getUuidRepresentation() method <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoClientSettings.html#getUuidRepresentation()>`__.

   * - **directConnection**
     - boolean
     - Specifies that the driver must connect to the host directly.

`ConnectionString <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/ConnectionString.html>`__
API reference page.
