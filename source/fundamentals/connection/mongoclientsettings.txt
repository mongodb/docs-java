Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn about the different settings to control
the behavior of your ``MongoClient``.

You can control the behavior of your ``MongoCleint`` by creating and passing in a 
`MongoClientSettings <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoClientSettings.html>`__
object to the `MongoClients.create() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-sync/com/mongodb/client/MongoClients.html#create(com.mongodb.MongoClientSettings)>`__
method.

To create a ``MongoClientSettings`` object, use the
``MongoClientSettings.builder()`` method and chain methods to specify
your desired settings. After chaining all the settings you want, use the
``build()`` method to create the ``MongoClientSettings`` object.

Example
~~~~~~~

This example demonstrates specifying a ``ConnectionString``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/mcs.java
   :start-after: begin ConnectionString
   :end-before: end ConnectionString
   :language: java
   :emphasize-lines: 3
   :dedent:

.. tip::

   If you omit the ``applyConnectionString()`` method, the driver
   attempts to connect to ``localhost``.

For a list of methods available in ``MongoClientSettings``, 
see the `API Documentation <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoClientSettings.Builder.html>`__.

The following sections describe commonly used settings:

- :ref:`Cluster Settings <mcs-cluster-settings>`
- :ref:`Socket Settings <mcs-socket-settings>`
- :ref:`Connection Pool Settings <mcs-connectionpool-settings>`
- :ref:`Server Settings <mcs-server-settings>`
- :ref:`TLS/SSL Settings <mcs-ssl-settings>`

.. _mcs-cluster-settings:

Cluster Settings
----------------

Chain the `applyToClusterSettings() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoClientSettings.Builder.html#applyToClusterSettings(com.mongodb.Block)>`__
method to modify the driver's behavior when interacting with your
MongoDB cluster.

Example
~~~~~~~

This example specifies the driver to connect directly to a server,
regardless of the type of MongoDB cluster its' a part of:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/mcs.java
   :start-after: begin ClusterSettings
   :end-before: end ClusterSettings
   :language: java
   :emphasize-lines: 3-4
   :dedent:

.. tip::

   This is analogous to the :ref:`directConnection
   <direct-connection-option>` parameter you can specify in your connection
   URI.

For a list of methods you can use to specify your cluster settings, see
the `API Documentation <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/connection/ClusterSettings.Builder.html>`__.

.. _mcs-socket-settings:

Socket Settings
---------------

Chain the `applyToSocketSettings() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoClientSettings.Builder.html#applyToSocketSettings(com.mongodb.Block)>`__
method to modify the driver's behavior when connecting and communicating
with your MongoDB server.

Example
~~~~~~~

This example specifies the following driver behavior in a MongoDB socket:

- To connect to an available socket within ``10 SECONDS``
- To read from an available socket within ``15 SECONDS``

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/mcs.java
   :start-after: begin SocketSettings
   :end-before: end SocketSettings
   :language: java
   :emphasize-lines: 3-5
   :dedent:

For a list of methods you can use to specify your socket settings, see
the `API Documentation <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/connection/SocketSettings.Builder.html>`__.

.. _mcs-connectionpool-settings:

Connection Pool Settings
------------------------

Chain the `applyToConnectionPoolSettings() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoClientSettings.Builder.html#applyToConnectionPoolSettings(com.mongodb.Block)>`__
method to modify the way the driver manages its' connection pool.

Example
~~~~~~~

This example specifies the following driver behavior in a pool of
``Connection`` types:

- The thread to wait at most ``3 MINUTES`` for an available connection
- To have at most ``200`` connections associated with the pool

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/mcs.java
   :start-after: begin ConnectionPoolSettings
   :end-before: end ConnectionPoolSettings
   :language: java
   :emphasize-lines: 3-5
   :dedent:

For a list of methods you can use to specify your connection pool
settings, see the `API Documentation <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/connection/ConnectionPoolSettings.Builder.html>`__.

.. _mcs-server-settings:

Server Settings
---------------

Chain the `applyToServerSettings() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoClientSettings.Builder.html#applyToServerSettings(com.mongodb.Block)>`__
method to modify the driver's behavior when monitoring each MongoDB
server.

Example
~~~~~~~

This example specifies the following driver behavior in a MongoDB server:

- To interval between server monitoring checks to be at least ``700 MILLISECONDS`` 
- The cluster monitor to attempt reaching a server every ``15 SECONDS``

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/mcs.java
   :start-after: begin ServerSettings
   :end-before: end ServerSettings
   :language: java
   :emphasize-lines: 3-5
   :dedent:

For a list of methods you can use to specify your server settings, see
the `API Documentation <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/connection/ServerSettings.Builder.html>`__.

.. _mcs-ssl-settings:

TLS/SSL Settings
----------------

Chain the `applyToSslSettings() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoClientSettings.Builder.html#applyToSslSettings(com.mongodb.Block)>`__
method to modify the driver's behavior when using TLS/SSL to secure a
connection between your application and MongoDB.

Example
~~~~~~~

This example specifies the following driver behavior for connecting to
MongoDB with TLS/SSL:

- To ensure your Atlas connection string works
- To not allow a mismatched ``hostname`` in the server and certificate

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/mcs.java
   :start-after: begin SslSettings
   :end-before: end SslSettings
   :language: java
   :emphasize-lines: 3-5
   :dedent:

.. tip::

   If you connect to localhost, you must disable TLS/SSL because there is no certificate.

For a list of methods you can use to specify your TLS/SSL settings, see the
`API Documentation <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/connection/SslSettings.Builder.html>`__.
