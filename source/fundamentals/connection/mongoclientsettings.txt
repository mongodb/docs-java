Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the different settings to
control the behavior of your ``MongoClient``.

You can control the behavior of your ``MongoClient`` by passing in a
`MongoClientSettings <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoClientSettings.html>`__
object to the `MongoClients.create() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-sync/com/mongodb/client/MongoClients.html#create(com.mongodb.MongoClientSettings)>`__
method.

In your ``MongoClientSettings``, you can specify the following settings:

- :ref:`Cluster Settings <mcs-cluster-settings>`
- :ref:`Socket Settings <mcs-socket-settings>`
- :ref:`Connection Pool Settings <mcs-connectionpool-settings>`
- :ref:`Server Settings <mcs-server-settings>`
- :ref:`SSL Settings <mcs-ssl-settings>`

To specify any of the preceding settings, use the ``MongoClientSettings.builder()``
method. This builder makes your ``MongoClientSettings`` immutable and to support
a simpler construction through chaining. You must use their ``build()``
method to create the setting to apply to ``MongoClient``.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following example specifies the ``MongoClient`` to use the settings
embedded in the ``ConnectionString``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/mcs.java
   :start-after: begin connectionString
   :end-before: end connectionString
   :language: java

See the `API Documentation <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoClientSettings.Builder.html>`__
for a full list of methods you can use to set your ``MongoClient`` settings.

The following sections describe the builder and method to use with an
example on how to construct your ``MongoClient`` for specific settings
to apply.

.. _mcs-cluster-settings:

Cluster Settings
----------------

Pass a ``ClusterSettings.Builder`` object to the `applyToClusterSettings() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoClientSettings.Builder.html#applyToClusterSettings(com.mongodb.Block)>`__
to specify settings on how to connect to a MongoDB cluster. 

Example
~~~~~~~

The following example specifies the following settings for the cluster:

- The selection to take at most five milliseconds
- To operate in a ``LOAD_BALANCED`` mode
- To use ``host1`` as the host on port ``27017``

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/mcs.java
   :start-after: begin clusterSettings
   :end-before: end clusterSettings
   :language: java

See the `API Documentation
<{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/connection/ClusterSettings.Builder.html>`__
for a full list of methods you can use to set your cluster settings.

.. _mcs-socket-settings:

Socket Settings
---------------

Pass a ``SocketSettings.Builder`` object to the `applyToSocketSettings() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoClientSettings.Builder.html#applyToSocketSettings(com.mongodb.Block)>`__
to specify settings on how to connect to a MongoDB server.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following example specifies the following settings for the socket:

- The time to connect to take at most 1000 milliseconds
- The time to read from the socket to take at most 10 seconds

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/mcs.java
   :start-after: begin SocketSettings
   :end-before: end SocketSettings
   :language: java

See the `API Documentation
<{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/connection/SocketSettings.Builder.html>`__
for a full list of methods you can use to set your socket settings.

.. _mcs-connectionpool-settings:

Connection Pool Settings
------------------------

Pass a ``ConnectionPoolSettings.Builder`` object to the `applyToConnectionPoolSettings() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoClientSettings.Builder.html#applyToConnectionPoolSettings(com.mongodb.Block)>`__
to specify settings related to a pool of connections to a MongoDB server.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following example specifies the following settings for the
connection pool:

- The time for a thread to wait for an available connection to take at most five seconds
- There should be at least one connection
- The time a pooled connection to live for to be at most 20 milliseconds

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/mcs.java
   :start-after: begin ConnectionPoolSettings
   :end-before: end ConnectionPoolSettings
   :language: java

See the `API Documentation
<{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/connection/ConnectionPoolSettings.Builder.html>`__
for a full list of methods you can use to set your connection pool settings.

.. _mcs-server-settings:

Server Settings
---------------

Pass a ``ServerSettings.Builder`` object to the `applyToServerSettings() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoClientSettings.Builder.html#applyToServerSettings(com.mongodb.Block)>`__
to specify settings on how to monitor each server.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following example specifies the following settings for the
server:

- The heartbeat frequency to be at least 10 milliseconds
- The cluster monitor to attempt reaching a server every three seconds

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/mcs.java
   :start-after: begin ServerSettings
   :end-before: end ServerSettings
   :language: java

See the `API Documentation
<{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/connection/ServerSettings.Builder.html>`__
for a full list of methods you can use to set your server settings.

.. _mcs-ssl-settings:

SSL Settings
------------

Pass a ``SslSettings.Builder`` object to the `applyToSslSettings() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoClientSettings.Builder.html#applyToSslSettings(com.mongodb.Block)>`__
to specify settings on how to connect to MongoDB though SSL.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following example specifies the following settings for the SSL:

- To enable SSL
- To not allow invalid host names

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/mcs.java
   :start-after: begin SslSettings
   :end-before: end SslSettings
   :language: java

See the `API Documentation
<{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/connection/SslSettings.Builder.html>`__
for a full list of methods you can use to set your SSL settings.
