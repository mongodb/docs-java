Overview
--------

Indexes support the efficient execution of queries in MongoDB. Without indexes, MongoDB must scan *every* document in a
collection (a *collection scan*) to find the documents that match each query. These collection scans are slow and can
negatively affect the performance of your application. If an appropriate index exists for a query, MongoDB can use the
index to limit the number of documents it must inspect.


Query Coverage and Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you execute a query against MongoDB, your command can include various elements:

- query criteria that specify field(s) and value(s) you are looking for
- options that affect the query's execution (e.g. read concern)
- projection criteria to specify the fields MongoDB should return (optional)
- sort criteria to specify the order documents will be returned from MongoDB (optional)

When all the fields specified in the query, projection, and sort are indexed, MongoDB returns results
directly from the index without scanning any documents in the collection or loading them into memory.

.. important:: Sort Order

   Set your sort criteria to match or invert the order that you specified the index.

   .. example::

      Consider an index on the fields "name" in ascending order (A-Z), "age" in descending order (9-0):

      .. code-block:: json

         name_1_age_-1

      MongoDB would use this index when you sort your data by either:

      - "name" ascending, "age" descending
      - "name" descending, "age" ascending

      Specifying a sort order of "name" and "age" ascending or "name" and "age" descending would require an in-memory
      sort.

For additional information on how to ensure your index covers your query criteria and projection, see the MongoDB manual
articles on :manual:`query coverage </core/query-optimization/#read-operations-covered-query>`.

Operational Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To improve query performance, build indexes on fields that appear often in your application's queries and operations
that return sorted results. Each index that you add consumes disk space and memory when active so you should track index
memory and disk usage for capacity planning. In addition, when a write operation updates an indexed field, MongoDB also
has to update the related index.

For more information on designing your data model and choosing indexes appropriate for your application, see the MongoDB
server documentation on :manual:`Indexing Strategies </applications/indexes>` and
:manual:`Data Modeling and Indexes </core/data-model-operations/#data-model-indexes>`.

Index Types
-----------

MongoDB supports a number of different index types to support querying your data. The following sections describe the
most common index types and provide sample code for creating each index type.

.. common-content-end

.. driver-content-begin

.. tip::

   The MongoDB Java Driver provides the :java-core-api:`Indexes </com/mongodb/client/model/Indexes.html>` class that
   includes static factory methods to create index specification documents for different MongoDB Index key types.

The following examples use the
:java-sync-api:`createIndex </com/mongodb/client/MongoCollection.html#createIndex(org.bson.conversions.Bson,com.mongodb.client.model.IndexOptions)>`
to create various indexes, and the following setup:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/IndexPage.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin declaration
   :end-before: end declaration

.. driver-content-end

.. common-content-begin

Single Field and Compound Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Single Field Indexes
++++++++++++++++++++

**Single field indexes** are indexes that improve performance for queries that specify ascending or descending sort
order on a single field of a document.

The following example creates an index in ascending order on the ``title`` field:

.. common-content-end

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/IndexPage.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin single index
   :end-before: end single index

The following is an example of a query that would be covered by the index created above:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/IndexPage.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin covered single query
   :end-before: end covered single query

See the MongoDB server manual section on :manual:`single field indexes </core/index-single>` for more information.

Compound Indexes
++++++++++++++++

**Compound indexes** are indexes that improve performance for queries that specify ascending or descending sort order
for *multiple* fields of a document. You must specify the direction (ascending or descending) for each field in the
index.

The following example creates a compound index on the ``type`` and ``rated`` fields:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/IndexPage.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin compound index
   :end-before: end compound index

The following is an example of a query that would be covered by the index created above:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/IndexPage.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin covered compound query
   :end-before: end covered compound query


See the MongoDB server manual section on :manual:`Compound indexes </core/index-compound>` for more information.

Multikey Indexes (Indexes on Array Fields)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multikey indexes** are indexes that improve performance for queries that specify a field with an index that contains
an array value. You can define a multikey index using the same syntax as a single field or compound index.

The following example creates a compound, multikey index on the ``rated``, ``genres`` (an array of Strings), and
``title`` fields:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/IndexPage.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin multikey index
   :end-before: end multikey index

The following is an example of a query that would be covered by the index created above:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/IndexPage.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin covered multikey query
   :end-before: end covered multikey query

Multikey indexes behave differently from non-multikey indexes in terms of query coverage, index bound computation, and
sort behavior. For a full explanation of multikey indexes, including a discussion of their behavior and limitations,
refer to the :manual:`Multikey Indexes page </core/index-multikey>` in the MongoDB manual.

Text Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Text indexes** support text search queries on string content. These indexes can include any field whose value is a
string or an array of string elements. MongoDB supports text search for various languages. You can specify the default
language as an option when creating the index.

.. warning::

   Collections are limited to one text index. Keep in mind that a text index can cover multiple fields.

The following example creates a text index on the ``plot`` field:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/IndexPage.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin text index
   :end-before: end text index

The following is an example of a query that would use the index created above. Note that the ``sort`` is
omitted because text indexes do not contain sort order.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/IndexPage.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin text query
   :end-before: end text query

For a full explanation of text search with MongoDB, refer to :manual:`Text Indexes </core/index-text>` in the MongoDB
manual.

Geospatial Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB supports queries of geospatial coordinate data using **2dsphere indexes**. With a 2dsphere index, you can query
the geospatial data for inclusion, intersection, and proximity. For more information on querying geospatial data, see
:manual:`Geospatial Queries </geospatial-queries/>`.

To create a 2dsphere index, you must specify a field that contains only **GeoJSON objects**. For more details on this
type, see the MongoDB server manual page on :manual:`GeoJSON objects </reference/geojson>`.

The ``location.geo`` field in following sample document from the ``theaters`` collection in the ``sample_mflix``
database is a GeoJSON Point object that describes the coordinates of the theater:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "_id" : ObjectId("59a47286cfa9a3a73e51e75c"),
      "theaterId" : 104,
      "location" : {
         "address" : {
            "street1" : "5000 W 147th St",
            "city" : "Hawthorne",
            "state" : "CA",
            "zipcode" : "90250"
         },
         "geo" : {
            "type" : "Point",
            "coordinates" : [
               -118.36559,
               33.897167
            ]
         }
      }
   }

The following example creates a ``2dsphere`` index on the ``location.geo`` field:

.. warning::

   Attemping to create a geospatial index on a field that is covered by a geospatial index will result in an error.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/IndexPage.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin geospatial index
   :end-before: end geospatial index

The following is an example of a geospatial query using the "location.geo" index.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/IndexPage.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin geospatial query
   :end-before: end geospatial query


MongoDB also supports ``2d`` indexes for calculating distances on a Euclidean plane and for working with the "legacy
coordinate pairs" syntax used in MongoDB 2.2 and earlier. See the :manual:`Geospatial Queries page </geospatial-queries>`
in the MongoDB server manual for more further information.

Unique Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unique indexes ensure that the indexed fields do not store duplicate values. By default, MongoDB creates a unique index
on the ``_id`` field during the creation of a collection. To create a unique index, specify the field or combination of
fields that you want to prevent duplication on and set the ``unique`` option to ``true``.

The following example creates a unique, descending index on the ``theaterId`` field:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/IndexPage.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin unique index
   :end-before: end unique index

.. warning::

   If you attempt to perform a write operation that stores a duplicate value that violates the unique index, the MongoDB
   Java driver will raise a ``DuplicateKeyException``, and MongoDB will throw an error resembling the following:

.. code-block:: none

   E11000 duplicate key error index

Refer to the :manual:`Unique Indexes page </core/index-unique>` in the MongoDB server manual for more information.
