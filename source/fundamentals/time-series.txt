Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn about **time series collections** in the
MongoDB Java driver. 

Time series collections efficiently store sequences of measurements over
a period of time. Time series data consists of any data collected over
time, metadata that describes the measurement, and the time of the
measurement.

Create a Time Series Collection
-------------------------------

You can create a time series collection using the MongoDB Shell. For
instructions on how to create a time series collection, see our
:manual:`MongoDB Manual entry on time series collections 
</core/timeseries-collections/#create-a-time-series-collection>`. 

.. important:: Use the MongoDB Shell For Administrative Commands

   You should not use the Java driver to perform administrative commands on
   your MongoDB deployment. Use the MongoDB Shell to perform administrative
   commands, such as:

   - :manual:`Create a collection </reference/method/db.createCollection/#mongodb-method-db.createCollection>`
   - :manual:`Create a user </reference/method/db.createUser/#mongodb-method-db.createUser>`
   - :manual:`Manage access </reference/method/db.grantRolesToUser/#mongodb-method-db.grantRolesToUser>`

Query a Time Series Collection
------------------------------

You can query a time series collection in the same way you query other
collection types in MongoDB.

For more information on querying data in the MongoDB Java driver, see the
following resources:

- :doc:`Guide on Retrieving Data </fundamentals/crud/read-operations/retrieve>`
- :doc:`Guide on Aggregation </fundamentals/aggregation>`

.. note:: Window Functions

   MongoDB version 5.0 introduces window functions into the MongoDB aggregation
   framework. You can use window functions to perform operations on a
   contiguous span of time series data. For more information, see our
   :ref:`Builders Aggregates guide <builders-aggregates-setWindowFields>`.
