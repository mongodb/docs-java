Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn about **time series collections** in
MongoDB, and how to interact with them in the MongoDB Java driver. 

Time series collections efficiently store sequences of measurements over
a period of time. Time series data consists of any data collected over
time, metadata that describes the measurement, and the time of the
measurement.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 33, 33, 33
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Example 
     - Measurement
     - Metadata

   * - Sales Data
     - Revenue
     - Company

   * - Infection Rates
     - Amount of People Infected
     - Location

Create a Time Series Collection
-------------------------------

To create a time series collection, use :manual:`the MongoDB Shell
</core/timeseries-collections/#create-a-time-series-collection>`. 

To check if you successfully created the collection, run the
following command:

.. code-block:: 

    db.runCommand({listCollections: 1.0})

Your output should look similar to the following:

.. code-block:: json
   :emphasize-lines: 8, 11

   {
     cursor: {
       id: <some number>,
       ns: "<db name>.$cmd.listCollections",
       firstBatch: [
         {
            name: <time series collection name>,
            type: "timeseries",
            options: {
               expireAfterSeconds: <some number>,
               timeseries: { ... }
            },
            ...
         },
         ...
        ]
     }
    }

Query a Time Series Collection
------------------------------

To query in a time series collection, use the same conventions as you
would for :doc:`retrieving </fundamentals/crud/read-operations/retrieve>`
and :doc:`aggregating data <fundamentals/aggregation>`. 

.. note:: Window Functions

   MongoDB version 5.0 introduces window functions into the aggregation
   framework. You can use window functions to perform operations on a
   contiguous span of time series data. For more information, see our
   :ref:`Aggregates Builders guide <builders-aggregates-setWindowFields>`.
