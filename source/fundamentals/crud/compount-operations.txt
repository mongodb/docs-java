Overview
--------

On this page you will learn how to perform **compound operations**. 

Compound operations combine a read operation and a write operation into a single
**atomic operation**.

An atomic operation is an operation that happens all at once from the perspective of
other processes and threads running on your computer. Atomic operations are
useful because your computer can't run instructions between them.
