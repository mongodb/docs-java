Overview
--------

On this page you will learn how to perform **compound operations**. 

Compound operations combine a read operation and a write operation into a single
**atomic operation**.

An atomic operation is an operation that happens all at once from the perspective of
other processes and threads running on a computer.

Atomic operations can fix certain kinds of **race conditions** in your code.

A race condition occurs when your code's behavior is dependent on the order of
uncontrollable events.

Compound Operations Use Case
----------------------------

In this section, we will go through an example that demonstrates the use case
for compound operations.

We go through an example race condition, and show how to use a compound
operation to fix the race condition.

For this example, lets imagine that we run a hotel with one room, and we have a
small Java application to help us check out this room to a guest.  

We represent our one room with this document in MongoDB. 

.. code-block:: json

    {"_id":1, "guest":null, "reserved":false}

`The full code for this example is available on Github here. <http://httpstat.us/404>`__

Example - Unsafe
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lets say our app uses this unsafe Java method to check out our room to guests.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CompoundOperators.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start the-unsafe-book-a-room
   :end-before: end the-unsafe-book-a-room

Now imagine two separate guests, Jan and Pat, use this method to book
our room from two different computers at the same time.

Jan sees the following output:

.. code-block:: none

   You got the room Jan

And Pat sees the following output:

.. code-block:: none

   You got the room Pat

When we look at our database, we see the following: 

.. code-block:: json

    {"_id":1, "guest":"Jan", "reserved":true}

Pat will be pretty unhappy as when she shows up to our hotel, Jan will be
occupying her room. What went wrong?

Here is the sequence of events that happened from the perspective of our MongoDB
instance:

- Find an empty room for Jan
- Find an empty room for Pat
- Update the room to booked for Pat
- Update the room to booked for Jan

Pat's reservation was incorrectly overwritten. Let's see how we can
use compound operations to fix this race condition. 

Example - Safe
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lets fix our ``bookARoom`` method using a compound operator.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CompoundOperators.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start the-safe-book-a-room
   :end-before: end the-safe-book-a-room

Now imagine Jan and Pat use this method to book
our room from two different computers at the same time.

Jan sees the following output:

.. code-block:: none

   You got the room Jan

And Pat sees the following output:

.. code-block:: none

   Sorry, we are booked Pat

When we look at our database, we see the following: 

.. code-block:: json

    {"_id":1, "guest":"Jan", "reserved":true}
 
Pat got the correct message. While she might be sad she didn't get the
reservation, at least she will know to not travel to the hotel.
