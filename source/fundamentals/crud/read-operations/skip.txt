Skip Returned Results
=====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

In this guide, we show you how to skip a specified number of returned results.

You can skip results using the ``skip()`` method on a result of a query or
in an aggregation pipeline. 

The ``skip()`` method takes an integer that specifies the number of documents
to omit from the beginning of the list of documents returned by the
:java-docs:`FindIterable </apidocs/mongodb-driver-sync/com/mongodb/client/FindIterable.html#skip(int)>`. 

You can use the ``skip()`` method to skip the first two documents as follows:

.. code-block:: java

   collection.find().skip(2); 

The :java-docs:`Aggregates.skip() </apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/Aggregates.html#skip(int)>`
is a stage in the aggregation pipeline where you can specify a skip criteria as an argument.  

You can use the ``Aggregates.skip()`` method to skip the first two documents as follows:

.. code-block:: java

   import com.mongodb.client.model.Aggregates;

   collection.aggregate(Arrays.asList(Aggregates.skip(2))); 

Using ``skip()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example is about a paint store that sells eight different
colors of paint.  The best colors sell quicker than the other colors.
One day, a customer asks what the three best-selling (lowest inventory)
colors are. The paint store keeps track of inventory in the ``qty``
field in their ``paint_inventory`` collection: 

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id": 1, "color": "red", "qty": 5 }
   { "_id": 2, "color": "purple", "qty": 10 }
   { "_id": 3, "color": "blue", "qty": 9 }
   { "_id": 4, "color": "white", "qty": 6 }
   { "_id": 5, "color": "yellow", "qty": 11 }
   { "_id": 6, "color": "pink", "qty": 3 }
   { "_id": 7, "color": "green", "qty": 8 }
   { "_id": 8, "color": "orange", "qty": 7 }


To address the scenario, you query the ``paint_inventory`` collection
with an empty filter, sort the documents by ``qty`` field and omit the first five
results.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/Skip.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin skipExample
   :end-before: end skipExample

- The ``find()`` method returns all documents.  
- The ``sort()`` method specifies documents to display from highest to lowest based on the ``qty`` field.
- The ``skip()`` method specifies to omit the first 5 documents. 

The following shows the output of the query specified above:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false
   
   { "_id": 4, "color": "white", "qty": 6 }
   { "_id": 1, "color": "red", "qty": 5 }
   { "_id": 6, "color": "pink", "qty": 3 }

After we run the query, we find the three best-selling colors are pink,
red, and white. 

.. note::
   If the value of skip exceeds the number of matched documents for a
   query, that query returns no documents.

   If the ``skip()`` method from the example above skips the first nine
   documents, no results would return since there are only eight
   documents. 

   .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/Skip.java
      :language: java
      :dedent:
      :start-after: begin noResultsExample
      :end-before: end noResultsExample
