This guide shows you how to store and retrieve large files in MongoDB using
**GridFS**. GridFS is a specification implemented by the driver that describes
how to split files into chunks to store them and reassemble them to
retrieve them. You should use GridFS if the size of your files exceed
the BSON document limit of 16MB.

For more information on whether GridFS is suitable for your use case, see the
:manual:`GridFS server manual page </core/gridfs>`.


How GridFS Works
----------------

.. GridFS is an abstraction that handles MongoDB operations that store and retrieve binary files.

GridFS organizes files in a **bucket**, a group of MongoDB collections
that contain the chunks of files and information describing them. The
default bucket name is ``fs`` which is used prefix the collections it
contains:

- The ``chunks`` collection stores the binary file chunks.
- The ``files`` collection stores the file metadata.

When storing files, GridFS splits the files into smaller chunks, each
represented by a separate document in the ``chunks`` collection. It also
creates a document in the ``files`` collection that contains file metadata
and references to each of chunks.

When retrieving files, GridFS fetches the metadata from the ``files``
collection and uses the information to reconstruct the file from documents
in the ``chunks`` collection. You can read the file into memory or output it
to a stream.

You can learn how to perform the following GridFS operations from the
following sections:

- Create a GridFS bucket
- Store Files
- Retrieve Files
- Download Files
- Rename Files
- Delete Files

Create a GridFS Bucket
----------------------

Create a GridFS bucket or reference an existing one

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/GridFSOperations.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start createGridFSBucket
   :end-before: end createGridFSBucket

Store Files
-----------

Store files using an InputStream

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/GridFSOperations.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start uploadFromInputStream
   :end-before: end uploadFromInputStream

Store files using an OutputStream

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/GridFSOperations.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start uploadFromOutputStream
   :end-before: end uploadFromOutputStream

Retrieve Files
--------------

Retrieve file metadata (all files, using a query filter)

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/GridFSOperations.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start findAllFiles
   :end-before: end findAllFiles

Retrieve file revisions

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/GridFSOperations.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start findFileRevision
   :end-before: end findFileRevision

Download Files
--------------

Download a file to a stream

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/GridFSOperations.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start downloadToStream
   :end-before: end downloadToStream

Download a file to memory

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/GridFSOperations.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start downloadToMemory
   :end-before: end downloadToMemory

Rename Files
------------

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/GridFSOperations.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start renameFile
   :end-before: end renameFile

Delete Files
------------

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/GridFSOperations.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start deleteFile
   :end-before: end deleteFile
