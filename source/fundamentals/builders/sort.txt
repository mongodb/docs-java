Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to specify **sort criteria** for your
queries using **builders** in the MongoDB Java driver.

Sort criteria are the rules MongoDB uses to sort your data. Some
examples of sort criteria are:

* Smallest number to largest number
* Earliest time of day to latest time of day
* Alphabetical order by first name 

Builders are classes provided by the MongoDB Java driver that help you
construct :ref:`Bson <bson>` objects. To learn more, see our :doc:`guide
on builders </fundamentals/builders/>`. 

You should read this guide if you would like to use builders to specify sort
criteria for your queries.

If you want to learn the fundamentals of sorting in the MongoDB Java
driver, consider reading our
:doc:`guide on sorting </fundamentals/crud/read-operations/sort/>`.

.. _sorts-builders-sort-sample:

The examples on this page use a sample collection that
contains the following documents:

.. code-block:: json

   {"_id": 1, "letter": "c", "food": "coffee with milk"}
   {"_id": 3, "letter": "a", "food": "maple syrup"}
   {"_id": 4, "letter": "b", "food": "coffee with sugar"}
   {"_id": 5, "letter": "a", "food": "milk and cookies"}
   {"_id": 2, "letter": "a", "food": "donuts and coffee"}
   {"_id": 6, "letter": "c", "food": "maple donut"}

The Sorts Class
---------------

The ``Sorts`` class is a builder that provides static factory methods for all sort
criteria operators supported by MongoDB. These methods return a ``Bson`` object
that you can pass to the  ``sort()`` method of a ``FindIterable`` instance or to 
``Aggregates.sort()``. If you want to learn more about the ``Aggregates``
class, see our 
:doc:`guide on the Aggregates builder </fundamentals/builders/aggregates>`.

For more information about the classes and interfaces in this section, see the
following API Documentation:
   
- :java-docs:`Sorts <apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/Sorts.html>` 
- :java-docs:`Bson <apidocs/bson/org/bson/conversions/Bson.html>`
- :java-docs:`FindIterable <apidocs/mongodb-driver-sync/com/mongodb/client/FindIterable.html>`
- :java-docs:`Aggregates <apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/Aggregates.html>`

Ascending
---------

To specify an ascending sort, use the ``Sorts.ascending()`` static
factory method. Pass ``Sorts.ascending()``
the name of the field you need to sort on.

The following example sorts the documents in the 
:ref:`sample collection <sorts-builders-sort-sample>` by ascending order
on the ``_id`` field:

.. code-block:: java

   import static com.mongodb.client.model.Sorts.ascending;

   // <MongoCollection setup code here>

   collection.find().sort(ascending("_id"));

The output of the example above should look something like this: 

.. code-block:: json

   {"_id": 1, "letter": "c", "food": "coffee with milk"}
   {"_id": 2, "letter": "a", "food": "donuts and coffee"}
   {"_id": 3, "letter": "a", "food": "maple syrup"}
   ...

Descending
----------

To specify a descending sort, use the ``Sorts.descending()`` static factory
method. Pass ``Sorts.descending()`` the name of the field you need to sort on.

The following example sorts the documents in the 
:ref:`sample collection <sorts-builders-sort-sample>` in descending order
on the ``_id`` field:

.. code-block:: java
   
   import static com.mongodb.client.model.Sorts.descending;

   // <MongoCollection setup code here>
   
   collection.find().sort(descending("_id"));

The above example should output something like this: 

.. code-block:: json

   {"_id": 6, "letter": "c", "food": "maple donut"}
   {"_id": 5, "letter": "a", "food": "milk and cookies"}
   {"_id": 4, "letter": "b", "food": "coffee with sugar"}
   ...

Combining Sort Criteria
-----------------------

To combine sort criteria, use the ``Sorts.orderBy()`` static factory
method. This method constructs an object containing an ordered list of sort
criteria. When performing the sort, if the leftmost sort criteria results in a
tie, the sort uses the next sort criteria in the list to determine the order.

The following example sorts the documents in the 
:ref:`sample collection <sorts-builders-sort-sample>` in descending order
on the ``letter`` field, and in the event of a tie, ascending order on the
``_id`` field:

.. code-block:: java

   import static com.mongodb.client.model.Sorts.orderBy;
   import static com.mongodb.client.model.Sorts.ascending;
   import static com.mongodb.client.model.Sorts.descending;

   // <MongoCollection setup code here>

   Bson orderBySort = orderBy(descending("letter"), ascending("_id"));
   collection.find().sort(orderBySort);

The output of the example above should look something like this: 

.. code-block:: json

   {"_id": 1, "letter": "c", "food": "coffee with milk"}
   {"_id": 6, "letter": "c", "food": "maple donut"}
   {"_id": 4, "letter": "b", "food": "coffee with sugar"}
   {"_id": 2, "letter": "a", "food": "donuts and coffee"}
   {"_id": 3, "letter": "a", "food": "maple syrup"}
   {"_id": 5, "letter": "a", "food": "milk and cookies"}

Text Score
----------

You can sort text search results by their text score, a value that indicates how
closely a search result matches your search string. To specify a sort by the
text score of a text search, use the ``Sorts.metaTextScore()`` static factory
method. For a detailed example showing how to specify sort criteria using
the ``Sorts.metaTextScore()`` method, see 
:ref:`the text search section of our sorting fundamentals guide <sorts-crud-text-search>`.

For more information, see the :java-docs:`Sorts class
<apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/Sorts.html>`
API Documentation.
