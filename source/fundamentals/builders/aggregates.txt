This guide provides an overview of the :java-core-api:`Aggregates </com/mongodb/client/model/Aggregates>` class
which provides static factory methods that build :manual:`aggregation pipeline
operators </reference/operator/aggregation/>`.

.. tip::

   For brevity, you may choose to import the methods of the ``Aggregates`` class
   statically:

   .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
      :start-after: begin static import
      :end-before: end static import
      :language: java
      :dedent:

   The examples on this page assume this static import.

Match
-----

Use the ``match()`` method to create a :manual:`$match </reference/operator/aggregation/match/>`
pipeline stage that matches incoming documents against the specified
query filter, filtering out documents that do not match.

.. tip::

   The filter can be an instance of any class that implements ``Bson``, but it's
   convenient to combine with use of the :ref:`Filters <filters-builders>` class.

This example creates a pipeline stage that matches all documents where the
``title`` field is equal to "The Shawshank Redemption":

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: begin match
   :end-before: end match
   :language: java
   :dedent:



Project
-------

Use the ``project()`` method to create a :manual:`$project </reference/operator/aggregation/project/>`
pipeline stage that project specified document fields.

.. tip::

   Though the projection can be an instance of any class that implements ``Bson``,
   it's convenient to combine with use of :ref:`Projections <projections-builders>`.

This example creates a pipeline stage that excludes the ``_id`` field but
includes the ``title`` and ``plot`` fields:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: begin project
   :end-before: end project
   :language: java
   :dedent:

Projecting Computed Fields
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The ``$project`` stage can project computed fields as well.

This example creates a pipeline stage that projects the ``rated`` field
into a new field called ``rating``, effectively renaming the field.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: begin computed
   :end-before: end computed
   :language: java
   :dedent:


Sample
------

Use the ``sample()`` method to create a :manual:`$sample </reference/operator/aggregation/sample/>`
pipeline stage to randomly select documents from input.

This example creates a pipeline stage that randomly selects 5 documents:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin sample
   :end-before:  // end sample
   :language: java
   :dedent:



Sort
----

Use the ``sort()`` method to create a  :manual:`$sort </reference/operator/aggregation/sort/>`
pipeline stage to sort by the specified criteria.

.. tip::

   Though the sort criteria can be an instance of any class that
   implements ``Bson``, it's convenient to combine with use of :ref:`Sorts <sorts-builders>`.

This example creates a pipeline stage that sorts in descending order according
to the value of the ``year`` field and then in ascending order according to the
value of the ``title`` field:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin sort
   :end-before: // end sort
   :language: java
   :dedent:


Skip
----

Use the ``skip()`` method to create a :manual:`$skip </reference/operator/aggregation/skip/>`
pipeline stage to skip over the specified number of documents that pass into the stage.

This example creates a pipeline stage that skips the first ``5`` documents:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin skip
   :end-before: // end skip
   :language: java
   :dedent:

Limit
-----

Use the :manual:`$limit </reference/operator/aggregation/limit/>` pipeline stage
to limit the number of documents passed to the next stage.

This example creates a pipeline stage that limits the number of documents to ``10``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin limit
   :end-before: // end limit
   :language: java
   :dedent:

Lookup
------

Use the ``lookup()`` method to create a :manual:`$lookup </reference/operator/aggregation/lookup/>`
pipeline stage to perform joins and uncorrelated sub-queries between two collections.

Left Outer Join
+++++++++++++++

This example creates a pipeline stage that performs a left outer
join between the ``movies`` and ``comments`` collections. It joins the
``_id`` field to the ``movie_id`` field and outputs the
results in the ``comments`` field:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin basic lookup
   :end-before: // end basic lookup
   :language: java
   :dedent:

Full Join and Uncorrelated Sub-queries
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This example creates a pipeline stage that joins two collections, ``orders``
and ``warehouses``, by the item and whether the available quantity is enough
to fulfill the ordered quantity:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin advanced lookup
   :end-before: // end advanced lookup
   :language: java
   :dedent:

Group
-----

Use the ``group()`` method to create a :manual:`$group </reference/operator/aggregation/group/>`
pipeline stage to group documents by a specified expression and output a document
for each distinct grouping.

.. tip::

   The driver includes the :java-core-api:`Accumulators <com/mongodb/client/model/Accumulators.html>`
   class with static factory methods for each of the supported accumulator.

This example creates a pipeline stage that  groups documents by the value
of the ``customerId`` field. Each group accumulates the sum and average
of the values of the ``quantity`` field into the ``totalQuantity`` and
``averageQuantity`` fields, respectively.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin group
   :end-before: // end group
   :language: java
   :dedent:

Unwind
------

Use the ``unwind()`` method to create an :manual:`$unwind </reference/operator/aggregation/unwind/>`
pipeline stage to deconstruct an array field from input documents, creating
an output document for each array element.

This example creates a document for each element in the ``sizes`` array:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin unwind
   :end-before: // end unwind
   :language: java
   :dedent:

To preserve documents that have missing or ``null``
values for the array field, or where array is empty:


.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin unwindPreserve
   :end-before: // end unwindPreserve
   :language: java
   :dedent:

To include the array index, in this example in a field called ``"position"``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin unwindIndex
   :end-before: // end unwindIndex
   :language: java
   :dedent:

Out
---

Use the ``out()`` method to create an :manual:`$out </reference/operator/aggregation/out/>`
pipeline stage that outputs all documents to the specified collection.

.. tip::

   The ``$out`` stage must be the last stage in any aggregation pipeline.

This example writes the pipeline to the ``authors`` collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin out
   :end-before: // end out
   :language: java
   :dedent:

Merge
-----

Use the ``merge()`` method to create a :manual:`$merge </reference/operator/aggregation/merge/>`
pipeline stage that merges all documents into the specified collection.

.. tip::

   The ``$merge`` stage must be the last stage in any aggregation pipeline.

This example merges the pipeline into the ``authors`` collection using the default
options:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin merge
   :end-before: // end merge
   :language: java
   :dedent:

This example merges the pipeline into the ``customers`` collection in the
``reporting`` database using some non-default options that specify to replace
the document if both ``date`` and ``customerId`` match, otherwise insert the
document:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin mergeOptions
   :end-before: // end mergeOptions
   :language: java
   :dedent:

GraphLookup
-----------

Use the ``graphLookup()`` method to create a :manual:`$graphLookup </reference/operator/aggregation/graphLookup/>`
pipeline stage that performs a recursive search on a specified collection to match
a specified field in one document to a specified field of another document.

This example computes the social network graph for users in the
``contacts`` collection, recursively matching the value in the ``friends`` field
to the ``name`` field.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin graphLookupBasic
   :end-before: // end graphLookupBasic
   :language: java
   :dedent:

Using ``GraphLookupOptions``, you can specify the depth to recurse as well as
the name of the depth field, if desired. In this example, ``$graphLookup`` will
recurse up to two times, and create a field called ``degrees`` with the
recursion depth information for every document.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin graphLookupDepth
   :end-before: // end graphLookupDepth
   :language: java
   :dedent:

Using ``GraphLookupOptions``, you can specify a filter that must match. In this
example, only links with "golf" in their ``hobbies`` field will be included.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin graphLookupMatch
   :end-before: // end graphLookupMatch
   :language: java
   :dedent:

SortByCount
-----------

Use the ``sortByCount()`` method to create a :manual:`$sortByCount </reference/operator/aggregation/sortByCount/>`
pipeline stage that groups documents by a given expression and then sorts
these groups by count in descending order.

.. tip::

   The ``$sortByCount`` stage is identical to a ``$group`` stage with an
   ``$sum`` accumulator followed by a ``$sort`` stage.

   .. code-block:: json

      [
          { "$group": { "_id": <expression to group on>, "count": { "$sum": 1 } } },
          { "$sort": { "count": -1 } }
      ]

This example groups documents by the truncated value of the field ``x``
and computes the count for each distinct value.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin sortByCount
   :end-before: // end sortByCount
   :language: java
   :dedent:


ReplaceRoot
-----------

Use the ``replaceRoot()`` method to create a :manual:`$replaceRoot </reference/operator/aggregation/replaceRoot/>`
pipeline stage that replaces each input document with the specified document.

This example replaces each input document with the sub-document
in the ``spanish_translation`` field.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin replaceRoot
   :end-before: // end replaceRoot
   :language: java
   :dedent:

AddFields
---------

Use the ``addFields()`` method to create an :manual:`$addFields </reference/operator/aggregation/addFields/>`
pipeline stage that adds new fields to documents.

.. tip::

   Use the ``$addFields`` when you do not want to project field inclusion
   or exclusion.

Th following example adds two new fields, ``a`` and ``b`` to the input documents.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin addFields
   :end-before: // end addFields
   :language: java
   :dedent:

Count
-----

Use the ``count()`` method to create a :manual:`$count </reference/operator/aggregation/count/>`
pipeline stage that counts the number of documents that enter, and assigns
that value to a specified field name. If you do not specify a field,
``count()`` defaults the field name to "count".

.. tip::

   The ``$count`` stage is syntactic sugar for:

   .. code-block:: json

      { "$group":{ "_id": 0, "count": { "$sum" : 1 } } }

This example creates a pipeline stage that outputs the count of incoming
documents in a field called "total":

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin count
   :end-before: // end count
   :language: java
   :dedent:


Bucket
------

Use the ``bucket()`` method to create a :manual:`$bucket </reference/operator/aggregation/bucket/>`
pipeline stage automates the bucketing of data around predefined boundary
values.

This example creates a pipeline stage that groups incoming documents based
on the value of their ``screenSize`` field, inclusive of the lower boundary
and exclusive of the upper boundary.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin basic bucket
   :end-before: // end basic bucket
   :language: java
   :dedent:

Use the ``BucketOptions`` class to specify a default bucket for values
outside of the specified boundaries, and to specify additional accumulators.

This example creates a pipeline stage that groups incoming documents based
on the value of their ``screenSize`` field, counting the number of documents
that fall within each bucket, pushing the value of ``screenSize`` into a
field called ``matches``, and capturing any screen sizes greater than "70"
into a bucket called "monster" for monstrously large screen sizes.

.. tip::

   The driver includes the :java-core-api:`Accumulators <com/mongodb/client/model/Accumulators.html>`
   class with static factory methods for each of the supported accumulator.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin bucket options
   :end-before: // end bucket options
   :language: java
   :dedent:

BucketAuto
----------

Use the ``bucketAuto()`` method to create a :manual:`$bucketAuto </reference/operator/aggregation/bucketAuto/>`
pipeline stage that automatically determines the boundaries of each bucket
in its attempt to distribute the documents evenly into a specified number of buckets.

This example creates a pipeline stage that will attempt to create and evenly
distribute documents into *10* buckets using the value of their ``price`` field:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin basic bucketAuto
   :end-before: // end basic bucketAuto
   :language: java
   :dedent:


Use the ``BucketAutoOptions`` class to specify a :wikipedia:`preferred number <Preferred_number>`
based scheme to set boundary values, and specify additional accumulators.

This example creates a pipeline stage that will attempt to create and evenly
distribute documents into *10* buckets using the value of their ``price`` field,
setting the bucket boundaries at powers of 2 (2, 4, 8, 16, ...). It also counts
the number of documents in each bucket, and calculates the average their ``price``
in a new field called ``avgPrice``:

.. tip::

   The driver includes the :java-core-api:`Accumulators <com/mongodb/client/model/Accumulators.html>`
   class with static factory methods for each of the supported accumulator.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin bucketAuto options
   :end-before: // end bucketAuto options
   :language: java
   :dedent:

Facet
-----

Use the ``facet()`` method to create a :manual:`$facet </reference/operator/aggregation/facet/>`
pipeline stage that allows for the definition of parallel pipelines.

This example creates a pipeline stage that executes two parallel aggregations:

- The first aggregation distributes incoming documents into 5 groups according to
  their ``attributes.screen_size`` field.

- The second aggregation counts all *manufacturers* and returns their count, limited
  to the top **5**.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin facet
   :end-before: // end facet
   :language: java
   :dedent:
