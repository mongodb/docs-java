This section explains MongoDB connection and authentication options
supported by the {+driver-short+}. You can pass the connection options as
parameters of the connection URI to specify the behavior of the client.

   * - Option Name
     - Type
     - Description

   * - **appName**
     - string
     - Specifies the name of the application provided to MongoDB instances
       during the connection handshake. Can be used for server logs and
       profiling.

       | **Default**: ``null``

   * - **compressors**
     - string
     - Specifies one or more compression algorithms that the driver
       will attempt to use to compress requests sent to the connected
       MongoDB instance. Possible values include: ``zlib``, ``snappy``,
       and ``zstd``.

       | **Default**: ``null``

   * - **zlibCompressionLevel**
     - integer
     - Specifies the degree of compression that `Zlib <https://zlib.net/>`__
       uses to decrease the size of requests to the connected MongoDB
       instance. The level can range from ``-1`` to ``9``, with lower values
       compressing faster (but resulting in larger requests) and larger values
       compressing slower (but resulting in smaller requests).

       | **Default**: ``null``

   * - **serverMonitoringMode**
     - string
     - Specifies which server monitoring protocol the driver uses. When set to
       ``auto``, the monitoring mode is determined by the environment in which
       the driver is running. The driver uses ``poll`` mode in function-as-a-service
       (FaaS) environments and ``stream`` mode in other environments.

       | **Default**: ``auto``
