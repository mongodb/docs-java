Introduction
------------

Welcome to the MongoDB Java driver documentation. This documentation is
for the *synchronous* driver. If you are working with asynchronous stream
processing and reactive streams, we recommend the `Reactive Streams Driver
<https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver-reactivestreams/>`__.

The official MongoDB Java driver lets you connect your Java applications
to MongoDB and work with your data. On this page, you can find descriptions of
each section of the driver documentation and where to go to learn more
about the Java driver.
