Introduction
------------

Welcome to the official MongoDB Java driver documentation.

Connect your Java applications to MongoDB and work with your data using the
Java driver. This documentation is for the **synchronous Java driver**.
The synchronous Java driver runs your operations on MongoDB sequentially
rather than in parallel. We recommend using the synchronous driver with
your application.

If you're working with asynchronous stream processing and reactive streams,
use the official MongoDB `Reactive Streams driver <https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver-reactivestreams/>`__
instead.

On this page, you can read descriptions of each section of the documentation.

Quick Start
-----------

Learn how to establish a connection to MongoDB Atlas and begin
working with data in the :doc:`Quick Start </quick-start>` section.

Usage Examples
--------------

For fully runnable code snippets and explanations for common
methods, see the :doc:`Usage Examples </usage-examples>` section.
