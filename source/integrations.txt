Overview
--------

On this page, you can learn about the tools and frameworks available for integration
with the {+driver-short+}.

This page describes the following third-party integrations:

- :ref:`spring-framework`
- :ref:`quarkus-framework`
- :ref:`graalvm-integration`
- :ref:`micronaut-framework`

.. note::

   MongoDB does not own the tools included on this page.

.. _spring-framework:

Spring Data
-----------

The `Spring <https://spring.io/>`__ Java framework offers flexible third-party libraries,
streamlined code features, and efficient performance to allow for fast and intuitive
application development.

Spring Data, a Spring umbrella project, focuses on database access for 
Spring-powered applications. Several Spring Data features, including a high-level
interface for database interaction and database query generation, simplify data access. 

Using Spring Data and MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Spring Data MongoDB <https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-mongodb/>`__ is one of the
modules included under the Spring Data umbrella. This module supports the use of MongoDB
databases during Spring application development. Additionally, Spring Data MongoDB reduces
the boilerplate code and MongoDB API knowledge required for MongoDB database access. The
module offers the following features:

- ``MongoTemplate`` helper class that implements the ``MongoOperation`` interface.
  This interface provides methods such as ``find()``, ``insert()``, and ``update()``
  to perform MongoDB operations.
- Exception translation that allows for custom, portable exception handling code
  without losing error information provided by the {+driver-long+}.
- Converter, called ``MappingMongoConverter``, to map domain objects to MongoDB documents.
  You can also write a custom converter.
- ``GridFsOperations`` and ``ReactiveGridFsOperations`` interfaces for interactions
  with the GridFS filesystem.

To learn more about Spring Data MongoDB and its features, see the `Spring Data MongoDB
<https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-mongodb/>`__ project overview.

.. _quarkus-framework:

Quarkus
-------

`Quarkus <https://quarkus.io/>`__, a Java framework, aims to leverage the functionality of
`Kubernetes <https://kubernetes.io/>`__ to create lightweight applications. Much like the
Spring framework described in the :ref:`spring-framework` section of this page, Quarkus
offers improved code efficiency and builds on a range of third-party libraries.
Quarkus also supports a variety of application styles, including HTTP microservices,
reactive applications, and serverless functions. As a result, the Quarkus development
model is adaptive to individual developers and application needs.

Using Quarkus and MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Quarkus offers the ``quarkus-mongodb-client`` extension to connect to MongoDB. This
extension allows you to create a Quarkus application that configures a MongoDB ``Client``
instance and interacts with data stored in MongoDB.

Additionally, you can install the ``quarkus-mongodb-panache`` extension to further
simplify MongoDB database interactions. This extension wraps the ``quarkus-mongodb-client``
extension and the {+driver-short+}. After installing ``quarkus-mongodb-panache``, you
can create compact Panache entities to represent MongoDB documents. Several annotations,
including ``@MongoEntity``, ``@BsonProperty``, and ``@BsonIgnore``, allow for
customized mapping between entities and MongoDB documents.

For details and instructions on using these extensions, see the following Quarkus guides:

- `Using the MongoDB Client <https://quarkus.io/guides/mongodb>`__
- `Simplified MongoDB with Panache <https://quarkus.io/guides/mongodb-panache>`__

.. _graalvm-integration:

GraalVM
-------

`GraalVM <https://www.graalvm.org/>`__ is a JDK distribution that uses an ahead-of-time
compiler, Graal, to compile Java applications into native executables. These executables
include only the code required at runtime. Consequently, GraalVM allows your application
to run faster, use fewer resources, and reduce its deployment cost.

.. _micronaut-framework:

Micronaut
---------

The `Micronaut <https://micronaut.io/>`__ framework allows you to create efficient JVM
applications. Designed for creating server-side microservices, Micronaut aims to
reduce application startup time and memory usage. The framework reduces code reflection
to achieve these performance improvements.

Key features of the Micronaut framework include aspect-oriented programming, inversion
of control, and automatic code configuration.

Using Micronaut and MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create a Micronaut application that interacts with MongoDB. To create this
type of application, use the ``data-mongodb`` or ``data-mongodb-async`` feature. For
instructions on specifying these features and creating a MongoDB-backed Micronaut application,
see the `Micronaut Data MongoDB <https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-data/latest/guide/#mongo>`__
guide.

The integration of Micronaut and MongoDB relies on Micronaut's serialization library and
BSON annotations. To access a MongoDB database from your application, you must create a class
that represents a MongoDB collection. Then, use the ``@MappedEntity`` annotation before the class
declaration. To learn more about this annotation, see the `MappedEntity
<https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-data/latest/api/io/micronaut/data/annotation/MappedEntity.html>`__
API documentation.
