   Single-Collection Design </integrations/spring-data/single-collection-design>

`Spring Data MongoDB <https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-mongodb>`__ is a
part of the larger Spring Data project that provides a 
high-level, consistent, and convenient way to interact with MongoDB from Java
applications. It simplifies database operations by offering repository
abstractions, custom query derivation, and seamless mapping of Java objects to
MongoDB documents using annotations. 

Spring Data MongoDB because can reduce boilerplate code, integrate smoothly with the Spring ecosystem
(including Spring Boot), and support both imperative and reactive programming
models. It is commonly used for building scalable applications that require flexible
schema handling and fast development cycles, while benefiting from strong
typing and Springâ€™s dependency injection and configuration capabilities.
