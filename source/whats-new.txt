What's New in 4.10
------------------

New features of the 4.10 driver release include:

- Implementation of the ``Accumulators.percentile()`` and
  ``Accumulators.median()`` methods for statistical aggregations.
- Interfaces in the ``com.mongodb.client.model.search`` package are now
  marked as ``@Sealed`` instead of ``@Evolving``. Sealed interfaces must
  not be extended or implemented by consumers of the library.
- Resolved an issue where the driver emitted duplicate log messages for
  retry operations. The driver now correctly emits one log message for
  each retry operation.
- The ``org.bson.codecs.Parameterizable`` interface is deprecated. Instead of
  implementing this interface on a custom ``Codec`` type, you should
  override the ``CodecProvider.get()`` method on the
  codec's ``CodecProvider`` if the codec is intended for a parameterized
  type.
- Support for custom DNS resolvers.
- Support for :ref:`qe-manual-feature-qe` (QE). To learn
  more about the requirements for using the QE feature, see the
  :ref:`Queryable Encryption Driver Compatibility Table
  <qe-compatibility-reference>`.
