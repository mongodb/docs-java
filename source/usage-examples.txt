Overview
--------

Usage examples provide convenient starting points for popular MongoDB
operations. Each example provides:

- an explanation of the operation in the example showing the
  purpose and a sample use case for the method

- an explanation of how to use the operation, including parameters,
  return values, and common exceptions you might encounter

- a full Java class that you can copy and paste to run the example
  in your own environment

How to Use the Usage Examples
-----------------------------

These examples use the :atlas:`sample datasets </sample-data>` provided by
Atlas. You can load them into your database on the free tier of MongoDB
Atlas by following the
:atlas:`Get Started with Atlas Guide </getting-started/#atlas-getting-started>`
or you can
:guides:`import the sample dataset into a local MongoDB instance
</server/import/>`.

Once you have imported the dataset, you can copy and paste a usage
example into your development environment of choice. You can follow the
:doc:`quick start guide </quick-start>` to learn more about getting
started with the MongoDB Java driver. Once you've copied a usage example,
you'll need to edit the connection string to get the example connected to
your instance of MongoDB:

.. code-block:: java

   // Replace the following with your MongoDB deployment's connection string.
   String uri = "mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster-url>?retryWrites=true&w=majority";

You can use the :guides:`Atlas Connectivity Guide </cloud/connectionstring/>`
to enable connectivity to your instance of Atlas and find the
:manual:`connection string </reference/connection-string/>` to replace the
``uri`` variable in the usage example. If your instance uses
:manual:`SCRAM authentication </core/security-scram/>`, you can replace
``<user>`` with your username, ``<password>`` with your password, and
``<cluster-url>`` with the IP address or URL of your instance.

For more information about connecting to your MongoDB instance, see the
Connection Guide.
